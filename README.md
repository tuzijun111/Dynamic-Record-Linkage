Dynamic Record Linkage


SimFunction contains all the similarity metrics.

Cluster contains Navie, GreedyDB(Hill-climbing) and incremental DB(Greedy) methods. 

The updates processing is controled by the DSframe class.

The ML model is built in python. And we call python script in the java programs.

All the experiments are run in the main function of the Synthetic synthetic dataset.
